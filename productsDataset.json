Handmade in New York. 75% wool, 25% cotton flannel. 3-roll-2 silhouette. Three patch pockets. Burgundy grosgrain trim on edge of blazer and top edge of pockets.\nHandmade cloisonn\u00e9 buttonhole badge included. Cross-stitched Latin motto FORSAN ET HAEC under lapel. Rowing Blazers house button in brass, made in Connecticut. Unlined back. Self-lined fronts. Single button cuffs. Ventless. Props not included.\nThis blazer has a modern cut and runs a little more snugly than most of our other blazers because of the hefty material. 36 runs short; 38-40 run regular. 42-46 come in regular or long. Model is 5'11\" and wears a 40.\n\"There is an oft-repeated myth that the blazer has its origins in the jackets worn by the crew of the H.M.S. Blazer in the mid-19th century. But this is a classic case of false etymology. In reality, the blazer was born in the early 1800s, in the rowing clubs of Oxford and Cambridge. There, the blazer served a practical purpose, keeping oarsmen warm during chilly training sessions. Many of these early boating jackets were brightly colored and bound with grosgrain ribbon. It was one of these designs that introduced the word \u2018blazer\u2019 into the English vocabulary: the vivid scarlet coats of Lady Margaret Boat Club at St. John\u2019s College, Cambridge, were nicknamed \u201cblazers\u201d on account of their \u201cblazing red\u201d hue. I (re-) discovered the first known use of the word \u201cblazer\u201d in the Wren Library at Cambridge when I was writing my book. I used the reciprocal privileges that came with my Oxford University ID and spent the day tracking down this reference. Its context is a crew list in the 1852 Cambridge University Almanack, which now appears as one of the inner labels of our blazers. The burgundy-on-burgundy is a refined variation on the very first \u2018blazer.\u2019\" - Jack", "images": "{\"1\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/Untitled_122c0b16-a747-4fab-a5a3-a0a1689cd2d7.jpg?v=1521053681\",\"2\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/mens_knit_blazer_2-30_36334a31-ba9a-4d55-a57d-1055faa7c534.jpg?v=1521053681\",\"3\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/2949_RowingBlazers012717_1145.jpg?v=1521053681\",\"4\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/2949_RowingBlazers012717_975.jpg?v=1521053681\",\"5\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/Photo-Feb-01_-3-28-56-AM.jpg?v=1521053681\",\"6\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/2949_RowingBlazers012717_954.jpg?v=1521053681\",\"7\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/2949_RowingBlazers012717_981.jpg?v=1521053681\",\"8\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/2949_RowingBlazers012717_965.jpg?v=1521053681\",\"9\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/2949_RowingBlazers012717_990.jpg?v=1521053681\",\"10\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/Photo-Jan-02_-3-48-50-AM.jpg?v=1521053681\",\"11\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/Photo-Jan-02_-3-50-06-AM.jpg?v=1521053681\",\"12\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/SB_Blazer_Brick_Swatch.jpg?v=1521053681\"}", "tags": "BLAZERS_FORMALWEAR"}, {"title": "Horn.

The story goes that one of the boys, William Webb Ellis, caught the ball and simply ran with it in his arms to the opposing goal. The sport was institutionalized with a firm set of rules for the first time in 1845 under the auspices of the famous Thomas Arnold, then-headmaster of Rugby School, who believed that teamwork and rivalry were paramount. He also instituted the House system at Rugby, with \"School House\" and \"Town\" as the two main rugby sides (for boarders and day students) within the school. The School House jersey featured an embroidered skull and bones motif, perhaps in reference to the more violent nature of the school's particular brand of football.", "images": "{\"1\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/rugby-skull-overshirt-web4.jpg?v=1537567080\",\"2\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/rugby-skull-black-detail.jpg?v=1537303742\",\"3\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/Rowing_Blazers_FW18-21-web_2.jpg?v=1537567080\"}", "tags": "TOPS_JERSEY"}, {"title": "E.

Model is 5'11\" and wears a 38.\nWe took our signature blazer fit and construction and rendered it in a rugged navy cotton twill, in the style of the cotton jackets worn at the annual Dutch Varsity regatta - where student rowers famously engage in semi-organized fights, grabbing each other by the lapels and trying to wrestle each other to the ground. Then we subtly destroyed it with raw edges on the lapel notches and around the edge of the chest pocket, and enzyme washed it to give it a soft, lived-in feel.

Feels incredible.\nRugby collar; three-button placket.\nThis rugby has a traditional fit. For a relaxed fit, order one size up.\nSo far, most of our rugbies have been recreations of really old-school international rugby jerseys; and most of these are solid colors, with oversized, intricate embroidery. But I do also love a good old-fashioned hoop stripe rugby shirt. Of course, to introduce these into our collection, I wasn't going to just pick any old random colors for the stripes. I went to a framed print that hangs next to my desk -- a chart from The Boy's Own Paper 1922 called \"Some Famous Rugby Football Jerseys.\" Two caught my eye in particular, and they happen to be the colors of two of the oldest rugby clubs in the world: Richmond F.C. and Birkenhead Park F.C. Birkenhead Park was founded in 1871, the same year as the Rugby Football Union (the first governing body for \"rugby-rules football\"). Their red-white-blue-white pattern is so old, but looks so modern. Richmond began as a soccer club, but was one of the founding members of the Rugby Football Union. Their black-red-gold colors were chosen on a whim in the 1860s and inspired by a Belgian army detachment training in London at the time. We're obsessed with the history and the stories behind the clothes, so this is the perfect way for us to introduce hoop-striped rugbies into our collection.", "images": "{\"1\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/rugby_richmond_1600px-2_1600x-m2.jpg?v=1540933581\",\"2\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/IMG_6712-bright-m-1600.jpg?v=1540933581\",\"3\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/IMG_6698-bright-m-1600.jpg?v=1540933581\",\"4\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/may_rugbies-1.jpg?v=1540933581\"}", "tags": "TOPS_JERSEY"}, {"title": "DERTBAG DESTRUCTION LONGSLEEVE TEE", "description": "100% 6OZ. 20/1 COMBED COTTON\n3/4\" BOUND COLLAR\nSCREEN PRINT ON FRONT & BACK\nMADE IN CALIFORNIA, PRINTED IN NEW YORK, DESIGNED IN CONNECTICUT", "images": "{\"1\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0285/2248/products/drop3-ls-explosion.png?v=1544644685\",\"2\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0285/2248/products/drop3-ls-explosion-back.png?v=1544644685\",\"3\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0285/2248/products/drop3-ls-explosion-detail.jpg?v=1544644685\",\"4\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0285/2248/products/drop3-ls-collar.png?v=1544644709\"}", "tags": "TOPS_LS TEES"}, {"title": "Leopard Track Jacket", "description": "Description\nTonal tan color track jacket with black piping detail and Leopard icon at chest.

We searched everywhere for an Oxford cloth with body and substance but one that is also soft. An Oxford that ages like a good Oxford should. An Oxford that will be with you through the good times and bad. An Oxford that really becomes part of the family. An Oxford that is not going to moan and complain if it's scrunched up at bottom of your bag. An Oxford that doesn't retaliate and crease-up like its more delicate contemporaries. It's an Oxford that understands that you're busy and is just happy to be involved. It's a resilient little Oxford. An Oxford that is made like Oxford cloth used to be made. It's everything you are looking for in an Oxford and more importantly everything you need from a friend.\nNext we made a few tweaks to the basic design. The classic button down collar has been usurped by an elegant one piece construction. The pocket is slightly larger than usual and set a touch lower so the shirt has a more relaxed image. The stitching is finer and set at a tighter spacing, and the cut is a little slimmer than your classic American boxy button down.\nOrder now as this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.\nDetails and Care:- 100% cotton- Made in Poland- Cold gentle machine wash, warm iron, do not bleach", "images": "{\"1\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0015/5490/7187/products/Blue_Stripe_Oxford_Button_Down_Shirt_SHI0011_resupply.jpg?v=1542861969\"}", "tags": "TOPS_DRESS SHIRTS"}, {"title": "Corgi Big Pom Knit Two Tone Cashmere Hat in Green", "description": "Made from the softest pure cashmere and knitted in Wales, this pom pom hat will become your favourite winter accessory.

Established in 1911, Harry's New York Bar is the birthplace of the Bloody Mary, the Side Car, the French 75, and a long list of other iconic cocktails. The bar itself - decorated with wood panelling, foreign banknotes, the shields of Oxford and Cambridge colleges, and, most notably, vintage American collegiate banners and felt pennants - was a favorite watering hole for the likes of Jean-Paul Sartre, Ernest Hemingway, Rita Hayworth, Jack Dempsey, the Duke of Windsor, Thornton Wilder, Marlene Dietrich, Humphrey Bogart, and Coco Chanel. The Piano Room downstairs was frequented by Gershwin, who composed \"An American in Paris\" there. Harry's New York Bar continues to be a gathering place for intellectuals, celebrities, sportsmen and rakes. Many have been inducted into Harry's very own secret society, the International Bar Flies (or I.B.F.), whose icon - two cartoon flies - adorn the mirror behind the bar. To this day, Harry's is known for its limited menu: a wide variety of the best cocktails in Paris, and to eat... only hot dogs.", "images": "{\"1\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/jacket-harrys-beck_web_2.jpg?v=1548274806\",\"2\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/jacket-harrys-front_web_2.jpg?v=1548274806\",\"3\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/jacket-harrys-back-detail-1.jpg?v=1548274806\",\"4\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/jacket-harrys-1.jpg?v=1548274806\",\"5\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/Rowing_Blazers_FW18-25_ec121803-462d-4b45-b72d-845320aadcfb.jpg?v=1548274806\",\"6\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/9.jpg?v=1548274806\",\"7\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/1_99f0182c-8ab2-4840-809a-2a81602bd3ce.jpg?v=1548274806\"}", "tags": "OUTERWEAR_JACKETS"}, {"title": "Dents Gloucester Cashmere Lined Deerskin Gloves in Tan", "description": "Men's handsewn deerskin leather gloves with 3 points and strap fastening at wrist.\nDetails:- Leather: Deerskin- Lining: 100% Cashmere- Sizing: L (9.5-10), XL (10.5-11)", "images": "{\"1\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0186/1574/products/CORK.jpg?v=1544194134\"}", "tags": "{12,13,62}"}, {"title": "Aqua and Navy Stripe Tee", "description": "This versatile mid-weight top is crafted from jersey fabric with a substantial feel, for more structure and heft than our basic tees.

For a more fitted look, order one size down.\n\"This shirt is based on a vintage Yale polo jersey from the early 80s: it was beautiful. Navy blue soft pima cotton (no tech-y fabrics) with a hand-stitched white satin stripe - not too wide - running diagonally across the front. No one makes polo shirts like these (until now), and there's a reason why: it's not easy, because the pima cotton is a knit, and the satin is a woven. It has to be sewn by hand.

Authentic, but also modern and uncomplicated.\nThree-button placket (the good ol' fashioned way). Split tail. No logo on chest, because, come on, you either want the logo of some weird old club, or nothing. 100% Peruvian pima cotton. Props not included.\nUnisex (men's sizing). Classic / oversized fit. For a more fitted look, order one size down.\n\"This shirt is based on a vintage Yale polo jersey from the early 80s: it was beautiful. Navy blue soft pima cotton (no tech-y fabrics) with a hand-stitched white satin stripe - not too wide - running diagonally across the front. No one makes polo shirts like these (until now), and there's a reason why: it's not easy, because the pima cotton is a knit, and the satin is a woven. It has to be sewn by hand. But it's worthwhile, because the result is just right. I would never buy a pieced piqu\u00e9 diagonal stripe polo shirt; but this is a different animal altogether. You feel like Laddie Sanford, or like Steve McQueen in the Thomas Crown Affair. But it's also modern and uncomplicated. Our polos don't have any logo on the chest, because I like it that way; I either want the logo of some weird old club, or nothing.\" - Jack", "images": "{\"1\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/polo-yellow-grey-m.jpg?v=1533487616\",\"2\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/yellow.jpg?v=1533487616\",\"3\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/Yellow1.jpg?v=1533487616\",\"4\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/RB_Satin_Polo_Folded-5.jpg?v=1533487616\",\"5\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/RB_Stack-1_0118ade6-fea4-47e8-ab9f-70195107ad23.jpg?v=1533487616\"}", "tags": "TOPS_POLOS"}, {"title": "Made in L.A.

Navy blue soft pima cotton (no tech-y fabrics) with a hand-stitched white satin stripe - not too wide - running diagonally across the front. No one makes polo shirts like these (until now), and there's a reason why: it's not easy, because the pima cotton is a knit, and the satin is a woven. It has to be sewn by hand. But it's worthwhile, because the result is just right. I would never buy a pieced piqu\u00e9 diagonal stripe polo shirt; but this is a different animal altogether.

This is a limited edition collaboration. Please allow an extra 7-10 days for shipping.\nLondon-based artist Luke Edward Hall and Rowing Blazers founder Jack Carlson share a love for the Classical world. In Luke\u2019s case, it\u2019s an aesthetic fascination: the architecture of Greco-Roman temples, and the human and divine body in sculpture. For Jack, it\u2019s an academic pursuit: before establishing the New York-based menswear brand in 2017, he was a field archaeologist in Italy and earned a PhD in Roman archaeology at Oxford. The two met in 2014 when Jack\u2019s book \u2013 also called Rowing Blazers \u2013 was published. But they reconnected when Rowing Blazers launched as a brand, and the idea of a collaboration came naturally to both of them. The capsule is based on a series of five illustrations by Luke Edward Hall inspired by the ancient world: a Greek vase; the mask of Tutankhamun; a discus-thrower; a set of ionic columns in ruin; and a statue bust.\nAdjustable.

Established in 1911, Harry's New York Bar is the birthplace of the Bloody Mary, the Side Car, the French 75, and a long list of other iconic cocktails. The bar itself - decorated with wood panelling, foreign banknotes, the shields of Oxford and Cambridge colleges, and, most notably, vintage American collegiate banners and felt pennants - was a favorite watering hole for the likes of Jean-Paul Sartre, Ernest Hemingway, Rita Hayworth, Jack Dempsey, the Duke of Windsor, Thornton Wilder, Marlene Dietrich, Humphrey Bogart, and Coco Chanel. The Piano Room downstairs was frequented by Gershwin, who composed \"An American in Paris\" there. Harry's New York Bar continues to be a gathering place for intellectuals, celebrities, sportsmen and rakes. Many have been inducted into Harry's very own secret society, the International Bar Flies (or I.B.F.), whose icon - two cartoon flies - adorn the mirror behind the bar.

They are the perfect shirt for so many occasions. There is no wonder why they have become the go to shirt for some of the world's best dressed men.\nSo how have we improved on this classic piece?\nWell, we started with the cloth. We searched everywhere for an Oxford cloth with body and substance but one that is also soft. An Oxford that ages like a good Oxford should. An Oxford that will be with you through the good times and bad. An Oxford that really becomes part of the family. An Oxford that is not going to moan and complain if it's scrunched up at bottom of your bag. An Oxford that doesn't retaliate and crease-up like its more delicate contemporaries. It's an Oxford that understands that you're busy and is just happy to be involved. It's a resilient little Oxford. An Oxford that is made like Oxford cloth used to be made. It's everything you are looking for in an Oxford and more importantly everything you need from a friend.\nNext we made a few tweaks to the basic design. The classic button down collar has been usurped by an elegant one piece construction. The pocket is slightly larger than usual and set a touch lower so the shirt has a more relaxed image. The stitching is finer and set at a tighter spacing, and the cut is a little slimmer than your classic American boxy button down.\nOrder now as this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.\nDetails and Care:- 100% cotton- Made in Poland- Cold gentle machine wash, warm iron, do not bleach", "images": "{\"1\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0015/5490/7187/products/Pink_Stripe_Oxford_Button_Down_Shirt_SHI0013_copy.jpg?v=1542861774\"}", "tags": "TOPS_DRESS SHIRTS"}, {"title": "D.S. & Durga Cowboy Grass Fragrance in 50ml", "description": "American sagebrush, flowering white thyme, &amp; prairie switchgrass from the wild western territories.

They are the perfect shirt for so many occasions. There is no wonder why they have become the go to shirt for some of the world's best dressed men.\nSo how have we improved on this classic piece?\nWell, we started with the cloth. We searched everywhere for an Oxford cloth with body and substance but one that is also soft. An Oxford that ages like a good Oxford should. An Oxford that will be with you through the good times and bad. An Oxford that really becomes part of the family. An Oxford that is not going to moan and complain if it's scrunched up at bottom of your bag. An Oxford that doesn't retaliate and crease-up like its more delicate contemporaries. It's an Oxford that understands that you're busy and is just happy to be involved. It's a resilient little Oxford. An Oxford that is made like Oxford cloth used to be made. It's everything you are looking for in an Oxford and more importantly everything you need from a friend.\nNext we made a few tweaks to the basic design. The classic button down collar has been usurped by an elegant one piece construction. The pocket is slightly larger than usual and set a touch lower so the shirt has a more relaxed image. The stitching is finer and set at a tighter spacing, and the cut is a little slimmer than your classic American boxy button down.\nOrder now as this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.\nDetails and Care:- 100% cotton- Made in Poland- Cold gentle machine wash, warm iron, do not bleach", "images": "{\"1\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0015/5490/7187/products/Red_Stripe_Oxford_Button_Down_Shirt_SHI0012resupply.jpg?v=1542862064\"}", "tags": "TOPS_DRESS SHIRTS"}, {"title": "Hudson Tab front Chino Short in Light Olive", "description": "The abbreviated springtime version of our essential everyday pant, in a soft sanded twill that\u2019s piece dyed for unique coloration and a subtly weathered look.

Navy blue soft pima cotton (no tech-y fabrics) with a hand-stitched white satin stripe - not too wide - running diagonally across the front. No one makes polo shirts like these (until now), and there's a reason why: it's not easy, because the pima cotton is a knit, and the satin is a woven. It has to be sewn by hand. But it's worthwhile, because the result is just right. I would never buy a pieced piqu\u00e9 diagonal stripe polo shirt; but this is a different animal altogether.

For a more fitted look, order one size down.\nHarry's is a legendary institution that made its mark in the worlds of literature, music, art, politics - and of course drinking. Established in 1911, Harry's New York Bar is the birthplace of the Bloody Mary, the Side Car, the French 75, and a long list of other iconic cocktails. The bar itself - decorated with wood panelling, foreign banknotes, the shields of Oxford and Cambridge colleges, and, most notably, vintage American collegiate banners and felt pennants - was a favorite watering hole for the likes of Jean-Paul Sartre, Ernest Hemingway, Rita Hayworth, Jack Dempsey, the Duke of Windsor, Thornton Wilder, Marlene Dietrich, Humphrey Bogart, and Coco Chanel. The Piano Room downstairs was frequented by Gershwin, who composed \"An American in Paris\" there. Harry's New York Bar continues to be a gathering place for intellectuals, celebrities, sportsmen and rakes. Many have been inducted into Harry's very own secret society, the International Bar Flies (or I.B.F.), whose icon - two cartoon flies - adorn the mirror behind the bar. To this day, Harry's is known for its limited menu: a wide variety of the best cocktails in Paris, and to eat... only hot dogs.", "images": "{\"1\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/polo-harrys-web.jpg?v=1548098896\",\"2\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/polo-harrys-detail-1.jpg?v=1548098896\",\"3\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/1.jpg?v=1548098896\"}", "tags": "TOPS_POLOS"}, {"title": "OS-1 Slim Fit Black Distressed Jeans", "description": "Description\nOS-1 Premium Japanese denim in washed black with hand distressing and paint drop details.

Established in 1911, Harry's New York Bar is the birthplace of the Bloody Mary, the Side Car, the French 75, and a long list of other iconic cocktails. The bar itself - decorated with wood panelling, foreign banknotes, the shields of Oxford and Cambridge colleges, and, most notably, vintage American collegiate banners and felt pennants - was a favorite watering hole for the likes of Jean-Paul Sartre, Ernest Hemingway, Rita Hayworth, Jack Dempsey, the Duke of Windsor, Thornton Wilder, Marlene Dietrich, Humphrey Bogart, and Coco Chanel. The Piano Room downstairs was frequented by Gershwin, who composed \"An American in Paris\" there. Harry's New York Bar continues to be a gathering place for intellectuals, celebrities, sportsmen and rakes. Many have been inducted into Harry's very own secret society, the International Bar Flies (or I.B.F.), whose icon - two cartoon flies - adorn the mirror behind the bar. To this day, Harry's is known for its limited menu: a wide variety of the best cocktails in Paris, and to eat... only hot dogs.\nUnisex.

But I do also love a good old-fashioned hoop stripe rugby shirt. Of course, to introduce these into our collection, I wasn't going to just pick any old random colors for the stripes. I went to a framed print that hangs next to my desk -- a chart from The Boy's Own Paper 1922 called \"Some Famous Rugby Football Jerseys.\" Two caught my eye in particular, and they happen to be the colors of two of the oldest rugby clubs in the world: Richmond F.C. and Birkenhead Park F.C. Birkenhead Park was founded in 1871, the same year as the Rugby Football Union (the first governing body for \"rugby-rules football\"). Their red-white-blue-white pattern is so old, but looks so modern. Richmond began as a soccer club, but was one of the founding members of the Rugby Football Union. Their black-red-gold colors were chosen on a whim in the 1860s and inspired by a Belgian army detachment training in London at the time. We're obsessed with the history and the stories behind the clothes, so this is the perfect way for us to introduce hoop-striped rugbies into our collection.", "images": "{\"1\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/rugby_birkenhesd_m.jpg?v=1540933615\",\"2\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/IMG_6720-bright-m-1600.jpg?v=1540933615\",\"3\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/IMG_6726-bright-m-1600.jpg?v=1540933615\",\"4\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/may_rugbies-2.jpg?v=1540933615\"}", "tags": "TOPS_POLOS"}, {"title": "Classic Silk Knit Tie in Khaki", "description": "A classic menswear staple.

Established in 1911, Harry's New York Bar is the birthplace of the Bloody Mary, the Side Car, the French 75, and a long list of other iconic cocktails. The bar itself - decorated with wood panelling, foreign banknotes, the shields of Oxford and Cambridge colleges, and, most notably, vintage American collegiate banners and felt pennants - was a favorite watering hole for the likes of Jean-Paul Sartre, Ernest Hemingway, Rita Hayworth, Jack Dempsey, the Duke of Windsor, Thornton Wilder, Marlene Dietrich, Humphrey Bogart, and Coco Chanel. The Piano Room downstairs was frequented by Gershwin, who composed \"An American in Paris\" there. Harry's New York Bar continues to be a gathering place for intellectuals, celebrities, sportsmen and rakes. Many have been inducted into Harry's very own secret society, the International Bar Flies (or I.B.F.), whose icon - two cartoon flies - adorn the mirror behind the bar. To this day, Harry's is known for its limited menu: a wide variety of the best cocktails in Paris, and to eat... only hot dogs.", "images": "{\"1\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/rugby-harrys_web.jpg?v=1548103310\",\"2\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/rugby-harrys-detail2.jpg?v=1548103310\",\"3\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/3.jpg?v=1548103310\",\"4\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/11.jpg?v=1548103310\"}", "tags": "TOPS_JERSEY"}, {"title": "LACOSTE LONG SLEEVE CLASSIC FIT POLO in Olive", "description": "Boasting long sleeves and thick cotton piqu\u00e9 material, this Polo Shirt ensures a comfortable, warm silhouette.

In the course of creating my book and accumulating my collection of vintage blazers, I realized there are certain ratios that look best when it comes to the width of the stripes.

We've made hats and ties with a carefully embroidered bee motif, and many of our blazers feature brass buttons adorned with bee and bee-hive motifs. Our double-breasted blazer is emblazoned with Latin proverb \"Ubi mel ibi apes\": \"Where there is honey, there are bees.\" But bee populations are dying at an alarming rate. And these tiny creatures play a gigantic role in our creating and maintaining our food supply, the stability of our ecosystem, and biodiversity. So we've decided to partner with the Honeybee Conservancy, a non-profit established in response to the bee crisis. The Honeybee Conservancy engages in education and outreach; and supports bee research and builds bee habitats, while increasing access to organic, sustainable food in under-served communities. And for this week - and for the next month - we are donating 20% of our proceeds from all four of our bee hats and our bee tie to the Honeybee Conservancy.

The result is 'Balloon': 100% wool fabrics\u00a0that are\u00a0woven with a natural stretch for comfort, but are extremely wrinkle resistant, allowing the jackets to retain their shape. The spring/summer version offered here is lightweight and woven for maximum breathability to keep you cool in the heat.\u00a0\nModel 254 is cut slim with\u00a0elegant detailing.

In Luke\u2019s case, it\u2019s an aesthetic fascination: the architecture of Greco-Roman temples, and the human and divine body in sculpture. For Jack, it\u2019s an academic pursuit: before establishing the New York-based menswear brand in 2017, he was a field archaeologist in Italy and earned a PhD in Roman archaeology at Oxford. The two met in 2014 when Jack\u2019s book \u2013 also called Rowing Blazers \u2013 was published. But they reconnected when Rowing Blazers launched as a brand, and the idea of a collaboration came naturally to both of them.

Established in 1911, Harry's New York Bar is the birthplace of the Bloody Mary, the Side Car, the French 75, and a long list of other iconic cocktails. The bar itself - decorated with wood panelling, foreign banknotes, the shields of Oxford and Cambridge colleges, and, most notably, vintage American collegiate banners and felt pennants - was a favorite watering hole for the likes of Jean-Paul Sartre, Ernest Hemingway, Rita Hayworth, Jack Dempsey, the Duke of Windsor, Thornton Wilder, Marlene Dietrich, Humphrey Bogart, and Coco Chanel. The Piano Room downstairs was frequented by Gershwin, who composed \"An American in Paris\" there. Harry's New York Bar continues to be a gathering place for intellectuals, celebrities, sportsmen and rakes. Many have been inducted into Harry's very own secret society, the International Bar Flies (or I.B.F.), whose icon - two cartoon flies - adorn the mirror behind the bar. To this day, Harry's is known for its limited menu: a wide variety of the best cocktails in Paris, and to eat... only hot dogs.\nUnisex.

Working button cuffs. Stunning material and craftsmanship. Feels incredible.\nRugby collar; three-button placket. Working cuff buttons.\nThis rugby has a traditional fit. For a relaxed fit, order one size up.\nAccording to legend, the game of rugby originated at Rugby School in England in during a game of soccer (football) in 1823. The story goes that one of the boys, William Webb Ellis, caught the ball and simply ran with it in his arms to the opposing goal. The sport was institutionalized with a firm set of rules for the first time in 1845 under the auspices of the famous Thomas Arnold, then-headmaster of Rugby School, who believed that teamwork and rivalry were paramount. He also instituted the House system at Rugby, with \"School House\" and \"Town\" as the two main rugby sides (for boarders and day students) within the school. The School House jersey featured an embroidered skull and bones motif, perhaps in reference to the more violent nature of the school's particular brand of football. We've recreated the Rugby School House shirt with obsessive accuracy (ours is based on an 1860 jersey), down to the band collar, all white placket, and working cuff buttons.", "images": "{\"1\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/web_rugby_skull_m.jpg?v=1542042828\",\"2\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/rugby-original-detail.jpg?v=1542042828\",\"3\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/RB_SS18_1_c33a32d6-30a1-49ea-a4dc-09f86b655a30.jpg?v=1542042828\"}", "tags": "TOPS_POLOS"}, {"title": "Beach Shirt Dark Blue", "description": "DESIGNED AND MADE IN NYC\nOur Beach Shirt is more of an Apr\u00e9s Beach Shirt.

We've made hats and ties with a carefully embroidered bee motif, and many of our blazers feature brass buttons adorned with bee and bee-hive motifs. Our double-breasted blazer is emblazoned with Latin proverb \"Ubi mel ibi apes\": \"Where there is honey, there are bees.\" But bee populations are dying at an alarming rate. And these tiny creatures play a gigantic role in our creating and maintaining our food supply, the stability of our ecosystem, and biodiversity. So we've decided to partner with the Honeybee Conservancy, a non-profit established in response to the bee crisis. The Honeybee Conservancy engages in education and outreach; and supports bee research and builds bee habitats, while increasing access to organic, sustainable food in under-served communities. And for this week - and for the next month - we are donating 20% of our proceeds from all four of our bee hats and our bee tie to the Honeybee Conservancy. Help us help the Honeybees, and visit thehoneybeeconservancy.org to learn more about what you can do for these magnificent little creatures.\nAdjustable.

Armed only with Microsoft Paint, and using the stripes of a vintage croquet wicket for inspiration, co-founder and former national champion oarswoman Keziah Beall designed what would become the brand's signature stripe. Rowing Blazers has made jackets for both men and women in the house Croquet Stripe since day 1, and they've graced the backs of celebrities from actor Will Ferrell to Olympic gold medalist Kerri Walsh, menswear icon Poggy \"the Man\", and Lance Thomas of the New York Knicks. The same stripe was used in an instantly sold-out shorts collaboration with Eric Emanuel this summer, a performance singlet collaboration with Tracksmith this fall, and a signet ring created with Jessica Biales this winter.

Both Rowing Blazers and Noah are NYC-based brands, and it means a lot to both to be able to partner with a program that has a direct impact on the community in which they create. 100% of kids at Row New York graduate high school and 99% go on to college; 100% exceed the CDC's recommended daily activity levels. Needless to say, these are much higher than city averages. 84% of participants row for free, and 53% come from families with a household income under $30,000. Over half will become first generation college students.", "images": "{\"1\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/blazer-noah-bronx_web.jpg?v=1539867841\",\"2\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/blazer-noah-bronx-detail.jpg?v=1539867841\",\"3\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/bronx_blazer_model_web.jpg?v=1539867841\",\"4\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/11050009_1_-web_826c9e9f-12ab-4ab6-b4d1-56e26e9489db.jpg?v=1539867841\",\"5\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/blazer-noah-bronx-detail_swatch.jpg?v=1539867841\"}", "tags": "BLAZERS_FORMALWEAR"}, {"title": "ESSENTIAL SERIF ZIP HOODIE", "description": "Composition_\nColor_\nMade in Portugal\nModel is 5'10'' 135 lbs and Wears Size Medium.", "images": "{\"1\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0237/8127/products/secondlayer-web_78_of_143.jpg?v=1535070375\",\"2\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0237/8127/products/secondlayer-web_80_of_143.jpg?v=1535070375\",\"3\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0237/8127/products/secondlayer-web_79_of_143.jpg?v=1535070375\",\"4\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0237/8127/products/secondlayer-web_81_of_143.jpg?v=1535070375\",\"5\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0237/8127/products/secondlayer-web_82_of_143.jpg?v=1535070375\",\"6\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0237/8127/products/secondlayer-web_83_of_143.jpg?v=1535070375\"}", "tags": "TOPS_SWEATS"}, {"title": "Stampede Long Sleeve", "description": "The classic Noble Gentlemen Brand \"Stampede\" long sleeve tee is made from premium mid weight garment dyed cotton.

If you go into The Bear wearing a club tie that doesn't already grace their establishment, you may have a piece snipped off with scissors in return for a half-pint of beer and a small card to complete with the club name, date and your signature. I noticed a swatch embroidered with a single yellow faucet and a card inscribed \u2018O.U. Bath Club.\u2019 Curious, I googled \u2018Oxford University Bath Club:\u2019 no results. So I undertook more formal research, to find that the Oxford University Bath Club (with sister institutions as near as Cambridge and as far as Auckland University in New Zealand) existed until the 1950s or so. It was not a formal club, as such, but rather a tie that was worn by those who had \u2018bathed\u2019 in one of the women\u2019s colleges.

Runs true to size (men's sizes).\nHarry's is a legendary institution that made its mark in the worlds of literature, music, art, politics - and of course drinking. Established in 1911, Harry's New York Bar is the birthplace of the Bloody Mary, the Side Car, the French 75, and a long list of other iconic cocktails. The bar itself - decorated with wood panelling, foreign banknotes, the shields of Oxford and Cambridge colleges, and, most notably, vintage American collegiate banners and felt pennants - was a favorite watering hole for the likes of Jean-Paul Sartre, Ernest Hemingway, Rita Hayworth, Jack Dempsey, the Duke of Windsor, Thornton Wilder, Marlene Dietrich, Humphrey Bogart, and Coco Chanel. The Piano Room downstairs was frequented by Gershwin, who composed \"An American in Paris\" there. Harry's New York Bar continues to be a gathering place for intellectuals, celebrities, sportsmen and rakes. Many have been inducted into Harry's very own secret society, the International Bar Flies (or I.B.F.), whose icon - two cartoon flies - adorn the mirror behind the bar. To this day, Harry's is known for its limited menu: a wide variety of the best cocktails in Paris, and to eat... only hot dogs.", "images": "{\"1\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/sweater-harrys-web.jpg?v=1548091402\",\"2\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/sweater-harrys-detail-1.jpg?v=1548091402\",\"3\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/14.jpg?v=1548091730\",\"4\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/rowingblazers20180810_2099_adb33da6-77ae-4c87-bbd4-ad5f906c00b9.jpg?v=1548091732\"}", "tags": "TOPS_KNITWEAR"}, {"title": "Big Three: Bench", "description": "Bench Squat Tee by Brett Lenger", "images": "{\"1\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2157/9141/products/yiwo_bigthree_ss18_bench_front_2.jpg?v=1527815278\"}", "tags": "TOPS_TEES"}, {"title": "PRINTED PROTOYPE CHAMPION SHORTS L", "description": "VINTAGE SHORTS\nSIZE LARGE, FITS MEDIUM/ LARGE\nHAND PRINTED", "images": "{\"1\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0285/2248/products/shorts-champion-l.png?v=1545336457\"}", "tags": "{25,9,11}"}, {"title": "100% Wool Watch Cap (Thunderbolt Wool Beanie)", "description": "100% wool navy blue watch cap, made in the U.S.A., with hand-embroidered wire bullion heraldic thunderbolt badge in front and Henry label in back.\n100% wool.

We make ours with love in the United States, and we make them extra long, so they hang down and peek out, even if your shirt's untucked.", "images": "{\"1\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1770/6343/products/belt-crimson_white-web.jpg?v=1544057783\"}", "tags": "ACCESSORIES_BELTS"}, {"title": "CAMP COLLAR SHORT SLEEVE SHIRT", "description": "Fit_\nCropped Boxy fit with embroidery detail on pocket\nComposition_\nColor_\nMade in Portugal\nModel is 5'10'' 135 lbs and Wears Size Medium.", "images": "{\"1\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0237/8127/products/SL_DSC03762_57.jpg?v=1545280331\",\"2\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0237/8127/products/SL_DSC03774_69.jpg?v=1545280336\",\"3\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0237/8127/products/SL_DSC03775_70.jpg?v=1545280340\",\"4\":\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0237/8127/products/SL_DSC03776_71.jpg?v=1545280347\"}", "tags": "TOPS_SHIRTS"}, {"title": "Terry Short Sleeve Sweatshirt in Sunset Orange", "description": "A short sleeve sweatshirt is a surprisingly stylish thing you can throw on over a tee for a pick up game, or a button down for weekend bar hangs.
